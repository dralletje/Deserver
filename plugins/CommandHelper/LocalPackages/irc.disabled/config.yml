# ******************* REPLACEMENT FILTERS *******************
# This section allows you to set up find and replace rules on
# every section of every message sent by CraftIRC.

# If you want to delete messages instead you should use the path filters, above.

# Each filter contains regular expressions for formatting variables.

# For example, you can change the prefix of IRC Channel Operators to something 
# different by executing a replacement on the %ircPrefix% variable.

# filters:
#   ircPrefix: ['@' : 'Op ']

# Or you could censor IP addresses to and from chat.

# filters:
#   message: ['(\d+\.){3}\d+' : '#.#.#.#']

# When writing searches, the following characters have special meanings:
# ^ $ . + ? * { } [ ] ( )
# If you want to use these characters normally, escape them with a backslash \.
# When writing the replacement, make sure you escape any $ or \ characters
# with an additional \ unless you want to use backreferences.

# Example: Changing emoticon ^_^ to $_$
 
# filters:
#   message: ['\^_\^' : '\$_\$']

# To delete a search, use an empty replacement, or none at all.

# This example shows two ways of deleting. The searches are xxx and yyy.

# filters:
#   message: [xxx, yyy : '']

# Remember that any list can be written in two ways.
# filters:
#   prefix: ['mod' : 'Mod', 'adm' : 'Admin']

# is equivalent to

# filters:
#   prefix:
#   - 'mod' : 'Mod'
#   - 'adm' : 'Admin'
